# Description

This is an API that allows the client/users to add captions to photos. 
The server runs on ExpressJS, Passport for local authentication, REDIS to cache user sessions, and Sequelize as the ORM to communicate with a Postgres database

## Objective

This was a learning project. My goals were to learn and implement:

1. Sequelize ORM :white_check_mark:
2. Local Passport authentication :white_check_mark:
3. User sessions with Express/Passport :white_check_mark:
4. Redis :white_check_mark:
5. Configure Redis, Sequelize, and Postgres for successful deployment to Heroku :white_check_mark:
